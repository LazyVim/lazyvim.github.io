# lazy.nvim

The [starter](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter) includes a pre-configured [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
setup that installs the **LazyVim** plugin and imports its plugins.

:::tip
The version for **lazy.nvim** and **LazyVim** will default to the latest
stable release.

If you'd rather use the latest development version, add the code below
to your specs:

```lua title="lua/plugins/core.lua"
return {
  { "folke/lazy.nvim", version = false },
  { "LazyVim/LazyVim", version = false },
}
```

:::

:::caution
**lazy.nvim** can be configured to always try to use the latest stable version
of a plugin, if a plugin has releases.

However, it's recommended to leave `version=false` for now, since a lot
the plugins that support versioning, have outdated releases, which may break
your Neovim install.

If you still want to try using the latest stable releases, you can set
`config.defaults.version = "*"`

Some plugins that are known to break with their outdated release will still
be forced to install the latest development version. To override that, specify
`version="*"` for those plugins. (see the **LazyVim** code)
